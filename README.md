This is my rust implementation of [Javid9x](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES)s' nes emulator.
There are two goals with this: 
 - Port a cpp project to rust.
 - Optimize it once it works.

This project really is a stepping stone to later create a snes from "scratch".


 ### Porting a cpp project to rust.
 ---

 I have never ported a cpp project to rust before and I think its a great opportunity to learn more about both languages.


 ### Optimizing this project.
 ---
 Once we can load roms and play a game on this emulator I will start looking at optimizing it.
 I'm not starting with this because the architecture most likely will change as I add more "chips" to this projecct.
